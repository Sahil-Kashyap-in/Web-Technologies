		<h1>Information About Computers</h1>

		<p> A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically.<br/> 
		    Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.<br/>
		    These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. <br/>
		    A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation.<br/> 
		    This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.<br/></p>

		<p> A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems.<br/> 
		    Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones.<br/> 
		    Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.<br/></p>
